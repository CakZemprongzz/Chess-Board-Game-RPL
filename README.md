# Chess-Board-Game-RPL

This project exist for an Assignment in Programming class.

The goal of this project is just to have a proper working chess game under Java 

Why this is on Java? On the last semester we are unaware that the applications proposal that we made last semester should be coded in Java. So, Good luck i would say

Bare minimum requirements :

1. Basic Working Chess Game
2. Main Menu
3. A "Simple" Database for storing user data

Keep in mind there is another feature will be added through out the development but the time is ticking and we need to get things done.
